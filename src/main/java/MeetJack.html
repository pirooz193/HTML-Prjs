    This site shows you the big picture, how all these subjects intersect, work together, and are still relevant. I
    don’t pretend to be the inventor of these concepts—most of them were invented by others during the past 20 years.
    But I think that the connection between refactoring, patterns and general programming principles still remains a
    mystery for the majority of programmers. This is the problem I would like to solve here.
